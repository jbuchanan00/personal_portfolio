            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h5>I am currently a student at Weber State University pursuing a Bachelors Degree in
                Computer Science. After taking an Intro To Programming class for another major, I fell
                in love with technology and being able to build tools and experiences. I attended a 
                coding bootcamp that allowed me to gain a foundational understanding of Software
                Development. I used this foundation to pursue the Computer Science degree that I have
                nearly completed. Besides programming, I have many personal hobbies that keep me 
                growing and learning. These hobbies include cooking, gardening, sports fandom, hiking
                and snowboarding.  
            </h5>
