        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h5>I am currently a student at Weber State University pursuing a Bachelors Degree in
            Computer Science. After taking an Intro To Programming class for another major, I fell
            in love with technology and being able to build tools and experiences. I attended a 
            coding bootcamp that allowed me to gain a foundational understanding of Software
            Development. I used this foundation to pursue the Computer Science degree that I have
            nearly completed. Besides programming, I have many personal hobbies that keep me 
            growing and learning. These hobbies include cooking, gardening, sports fandom, hiking
            and snowboarding.
