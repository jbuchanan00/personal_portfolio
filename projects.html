                            <p>This application can track different kinds of products for a small business owner. 
                                Seamlessly add, update, or delete inventory items. Depending on items that are
                                being added, the form adapts to the category being entered. The information that
                                is entered persists and is stored on a database. There is error checking to validate
                                the items being entered are accurate. We can also search the inventory list for 
                                items based on input and can include a category to add precision to the search.

                    <h5>Solo Personal Project</h5>

                        <li>
                            <p>This application is the game of blackjack in written in C++.  Rules of blackjack
                                are the player and dealer both get dealt two cards.  The player can see both of
                                their cards but only one of the dealers card.  After the 4 cards are dealt, the 
                                player can choose to "hit" which is requesting another card, or they can "stand"
                                which means they will play with the cards they have.  Once the player decides to
                                stand, the dealer will reveal the second card, if it is lower than 17 the dealer
                                will draw another card until they are greater than 16 or "busted" which is a total
                                card value over 21.  The winner is the highest side that isn't over 21.

                            <p>Though the program is used on the command line, there is a menu and interface the 
                                player can interact with. There is a player tracking system where you deposit 
                                and withdraw funds.  There is also a stat tracking wins and losses.  These stats 
                                are not persistent at this time.

                            <p>I have implemented the correct behavior of the dealer which is if the dealer
                                has a 17 but one of the cards is an "high" ace meaning it is worth 11, the dealer
                                will hit again until they have at least a hard 17 (no high aces) or busts.

                    <h5>Solo Relational Database School Project</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Objective of this assignment was to create a database program for a hotel chain
                                name FARMS. This database managed the physical hotels and rooms, reservations, 
                                guests, billing, and employees.    
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Created an Entity Relationship diagram planning out the relationships of the tables
                                and how we would organize our data. 
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Used T-SQL to create the database and input dummy data into the tables to have a working
                                database. Triggers were used to make sure data being entered was accurate.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>Used stored procedures with cursors to provide some functionality to users. One of the 
                                procedures is used to calculate the gross pay of an employee by fetching the clock-in 
                                and clock-out times to determine hours worked and uses hourly rate that is stored in 
                                another table to provide the gross pay for a pay period.
                            </p>
